# STATISTICS-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE
Performing Statistical Analysis for Data Science with Excel
This project explores the use of Excel for performing basic statistical analysis on a dataset, a foundational skill for data science tasks. By leveraging Excel's functionalities, we can calculate key statistical measures and gain insights into the data's characteristics.

Data Description:

The analysis utilizes a dataset containing various numerical variables relevant to a specific data science problem. The data may include attributes like:

Quantitative Variables: Measurements or counts representing numerical properties.
Qualitative Variables (Optional): Categorical data representing non-numerical characteristics.
Statistical Techniques:

This project demonstrates the application of a variety of Excel functions and tools for statistical analysis, including:

Descriptive Statistics:
Central Tendency: Calculate measures like Mean (average), Median, and Mode to understand the "center" of the data distribution.
Dispersion: Utilize functions like Standard Deviation and Variance to quantify the spread of data points around the central tendency.
Range: Determine the minimum and maximum values in the dataset.
Correlation Analysis: Employ functions like CORREL or PEARSON to assess the strength and direction of linear relationships between quantitative variables.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

The project may involve basic data cleaning steps using functions like TRIM or LEFT to address inconsistencies, and potential data transformations (e.g., converting text to numbers) to prepare the data for analysis.

Output:

The analysis will generate a comprehensive report within the Excel spreadsheet, including:

Summary tables with descriptive statistics for all quantitative variables.
Correlation matrices or charts to visualize relationships between variables.
Insights and observations derived from the statistical analysis, highlighting key characteristics and potential patterns within the data.
Benefits:

By performing statistical analysis with Excel, this project will provide:

A foundational understanding of essential statistical measures for data exploration.
The ability to identify central tendencies, data spread, and potential relationships within the dataset.
A springboard for further data manipulation and analysis using more advanced data science tools and techniques.
